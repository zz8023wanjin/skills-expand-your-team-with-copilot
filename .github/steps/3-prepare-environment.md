## Step 3: Preparing Copilot's environment

Let's provide Copilot some additional information about the school and typical tasks the teachers request.

To ensure future development is both smooth and reliable for everyone, Copilot should also start its sessions with all the tools and dependencies already installed. :rocket:

### 📖 Theory: Customizing Copilot's development environment

Copilot's environment can be customized in several ways. Below, we'll explore some of the most useful customization options:

📝 **Copilot Instructions**

The Copilot instructions file should provide repository‑specific guidance, preferences, and context before Copilot starts reasoning about an issue. Include:

- Project overview, including it's purpose, goals, and any relevant background information.
- Program architecture, standards and conventions that should be followed,
- Useful commands or scripts for common tasks

⚙️ **Copilot Setup Steps**

Pre‑configure the coding agent session with all required tools and dependency versions to ensure fast, consistent, and reproducible help. This typically means:

- Configuring required tools like Python, Node with desired versions
- Pre-installing project dependencies, libraries and running setup scripts

This greatly helps in avoiding delays or errors from Copilot attempting ad‑hoc installs

> [!NOTE]
> You can also [enable a Model Context Protocal (MCP) server](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/extend-coding-agent-with-mcp#adding-an-mcp-configuration-to-your-repository) for Copilot to provide even more functionality!

### ⌨️ Activity: Create instructions to guide Copilot

Let's write Copilot instructions that include details about the school, the roles Copilot should assume, and the common tasks teachers request. This will help Copilot interact more naturally with the teachers.

1. In the top navigation, select the **Code** tab.

1. Create a new branch with the following name:

   ```txt
   prepare-environment
   ```

   <img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c48deded-4214-4edd-9a50-d1368bfb12e8" />

1. Navigate to and open the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file for editing.

1. Replace the placeholder text with a link to the development guide.

   ```md
   ## Development Environment

   For detailed setup and development instructions, please refer to our [Development Guide](../docs/how-to-develop.md).
   ```

1. Add some additional information about the school and teachers to help Copilot interact more naturally.

   ```md
   ### User Interaction

   Consider the following when communicating with the staff.

   - The staff is not technical. Explain in simple terms as much as possible and avoid software jargon.
   - Any new code must be easy to maintain and understand, without significant coding experience.

   ## Program architecture

   - The website users are the students and teachers. Make sure the user experience is simple.
   - Do not make additional apps or services.
   - Do not make command line tools.
   - Do not create a long single file application. Always use an easy-to-understand directory structure.
   - Only use HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. No other languages.
   ```

   > 💡 Tip: You can add more details. Check out the `copilot-instructions-ext.md` file for ideas.

1. When finished, **commit your changes** to the `prepare-environment` branch.

### ⌨️ Activity: Prepare the coding environment for copilot

Customizing Copilot's development environment and adjusting [permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/controlling-permissions-for-github_token) is done with a unique [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow called `copilot-setup-steps.yml`.

For this project, we will pre-install the Python backend dependencies and ensure a MongoDB database is available for the backend to use.

1. Ensure you are still on the `prepare-environment` branch.

1. Navigate to the `.github/workflows/` directory.

1. In the top right, click the **Add file** button and select **Create new file**.

   <img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c135dd3f-72bd-4d2b-b21f-9c4968a06f5f" />

1. Set the file name to:

   ```txt
   copilot-setup-steps.yml
   ```

   <img width="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac615290-1045-45a5-8201-637721ef6fd2" />

1. Paste the following workflow configuration, which will pre-install the dependencies for the website's Python backend and setup a MongoDB service.

   ```yml
   name: "Copilot Setup Steps"

   on: workflow_dispatch
   jobs:
     # This is the required job name. If different, Copilot will ignore it.
     copilot-setup-steps:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
     # Starts a MongoDB service for Copilot to use during its session.
       services:
        mongo:
          image: mongo:7
          ports:
            - 27017:27017

       # Grant Copilot early access to read the repository content.
       permissions:
         contents: read

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v5

         - name: Set up Python
           uses: actions/setup-python@v6
           with:
             python-version: "3.13"
             cache: "pip"

         - name: Install Python dependencies
           run: |
             python -m pip install --upgrade pip
             pip install -r src/requirements.txt
   ```

   > 🪧 **Note:** Copilot will automatically retrieve the repository contents later. This workflow provides early access during setup to install the dependencies.

   > 🪧 **Note:** Copilot will automatically identify and install missing dependencies. Doing it now saves Copilot time and ensures proper environment setup

1. In the top right, click the **Commit changes...** button and commit your changes to the `prepare-environment` branch.

1. Create a **pull request**, but do **NOT** merge it yet. Mona will check your files to confirm they are correct.

1. After Mona shares the next steps, you **should merge** the pull request.

> 🙋 **Question:** How did the manual process feel compared to letting Copilot do most of the work? 🤔

<details>
<summary>🤷 Having trouble?</summary><br/>

If you accidentally merged the pull request before Mona shared feedback about mistakes, that is ok. Just recreate the branch and try again with a new pull request.
